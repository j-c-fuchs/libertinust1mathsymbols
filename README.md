# LibertinusT1Math symbols

This LaTeX document provides a list of the math symbols defined by the
`libertinust1math` package.

I wrote this document since I could not find any official documentation of all
the commands and math symbols defined by the `libertinust1math` package.
However, this is no official documentation.
The latter can be found at the [CTAN page](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/libertinust1math).
